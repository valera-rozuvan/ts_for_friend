# TypeScript example for a friend

A friend of mine asked me to help him converting a TypeScript file into a JavaScript file, adding missing type definitions in the process. This repository contains my solution, along with helper files such as `package.json`. So, all you need to do is clone this repo, and run:

```
npm install -g typescript
npm install
tsc ./index.ts
```

After the above steps, you will find a generated `index.js` file in the current directory. Enjoy :)
